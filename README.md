minigame
========

Basic game engine using pygame.

This is my attempt at a basic game framework.
The code will be firt based on Richard Jones tutorial on pygame (https://bitbucket.org/r1chardj0n3s/pygame-tutorial)

I will then add various improvments based on my own needs.

This code will most certainly be the base for my LD48 entry on 2014, April 25th-28th compo (http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/)
